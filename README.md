# Shellball

This is a shell thing I made about sports and rankings and playoffs and stuff.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hankypoo7/shellball.git
   cd shellball
2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x shellball.sh
3. Run the tool:

   ```bash
   bash shellball.sh
And boom! You should be good to go! :)
